## Guidelines

- For commit messages, make sure to follow the discussion [here](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53) as much as possible.
- Comment or let yourself be assigned to an issue before working on it. **Do not** work on an issue that someone has already commented or been assigned on, unless it is known that they are not working on it anymore.
- Create a separate branch for the feature/issue you are working on. For example, if you are working on the landing page, you run this command on your terminal or command prompt before starting your work:

```bash
git checkout -b ui/landing-page
```

Then check if you are on the ```ui/landing-page``` branch:

```bash
git branch
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
* ui/landing-page
  main
```
